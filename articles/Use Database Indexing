Django is well-known as a web framework for building database-driven applications.
This means that you would probably need to interact with your database a lot. When working with a large database,
creating database indexes could help you retrieve data from your database faster.

By default, databases use a sequential scan to fetch data from a database. This means that it would need to scan all
the rows in the database to complete a query. The execution time may not be noticeable in relatively small databases,
but for a huge database, it might be. Django provides us with a convenient method of creating indexes in our databases.
