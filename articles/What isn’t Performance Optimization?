One mistake a lot of developers make is optimizing code before identifying actual performance issues.
It is essential to profile and benchmark your code to find bottlenecks before investing time in optimization.
Focusing on tiny, insignificant optimizations that have minimal impact on overall performance can lead to complex and
less maintainable code.

Code performance optimization should be about making strategic improvements to code to improve efficiency,
while also making sure that the optimization doesn’t have an insignificant impact on the overall
performance of your Django application.

The purpose of this article is to show you some performance optimization techniques and strategies which you can
take advantage of to improve the overall performance of your Django application. Let’s jump right in.
